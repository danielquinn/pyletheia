# Thanks for using Aletheia!

This is the sort of project that only matters if others start to use it, so if
you're applying this code to your work or personal life, I want to personally
thank you for helping to build trust out there on the interwebs.

This file is here for everyone to post their own stories about how you use this
code.  It helps me to understand who's using it and why, and maybe to give
others an idea of how it might be used.  It's based on a Twitter exchange
between [John Glanville](https://twitter.com/hexapodium) and
[Julia Evans](https://github.com/jvns) and later better defined [here](https://github.com/paulmolluzzo/thanks-md). 

To contribute, simply issue a pull request that appends to this file something
like this:

```
### Your Name
